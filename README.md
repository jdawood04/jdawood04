## Hi! I'm Juliana Dawood (she/her)

### Welcome :)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently an undergraduate student at Stonehill College. My long-term goal is to become an Optometrist with my own private practice by fulfilling an OD degree at the New England College of Optometry (NECO). My research interests include visual sciences, ocular diseases, and advancements in optometric technology. In the next five years, I plan to graduate with my OD degree from NECO and become a licensed optometrist. My aim is to gain significant clinical experience and ultimately establish my own private practice, where I can provide comprehensive and personalized eye care to my patients. 

I am currently working as a Clinical Specialist at Visionworks, where I assist with patient care and acquire hands-on experience in the optometry field. This role has enhanced my understanding of clinical practices and patient management, further solidifying my commitment to becoming an optometrist. 

Check out my [R portfolio](https://github.com/jdawood04/R-portfolio) and public repositories for examples of my work. My portfolio repository showcases a variety of projects, including data analysis and visualization, which demonstrate my technical skills and attention to detail. Highlighted files include a data analysis project that features a detailed analysis of patient data, with visualizations that uncover trends and insights, and a function tutorial that introduces three key functions I developed, complete with examples and use cases. Feel free to explore these projects to get a better sense of my capabilities and the quality of my work.
